        <h2>Know His Majesty</h2>
        <p>Banana pudding is often known as a bowl of bananas made from pudding. However, contrary to popular preference, this recipe will show you how to make pudding <em>with</em> bananas.</em></p>
        <p>It's pudding. It's a gloopy gloop blob. What more do you want me to describe?? How puddingy it is!?</p>

        <h2>Sacrificial Lambs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large package vanilla pudding</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 can sweetened, condensed milk</li>
            <li>16 ounces sour cream</li>
            <li>(Optionally you can add 2 tbsp vanilla extract if you're feeling extra <em>spicy</em>)</li>
            <li>... Oh yea! Bananas, duuh. How could I forget? (psssst, don't just add 4 bananas like the other stupid website suggests. What maniac only puts 4 bananas in the bananan gloop!?)</li>
            <li>All the wafers. Like, an entire <b>box.</b></li>

            <p>Do note that if you put less cool whip, like only one of the small tubs, it has a more tart, kinda rich-ish flavor that is very enjoyable.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Ritual</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix milk and pudding together. (with a blender probably)</li>
            <li>Add funny milk, sour cream and the vanilla. Mix, duuuh.</li>
            <li>And then now you fold? in cool whip.</li>
            <li>Slice the bananas into little discs. (No, they do not work in the DVD player)</li>
            <li>Try to remember what that one herecy you unintentionally commited and Mother made a fuss about was.</li>
            <li>Line the bowl with wafers while wondering where you're gonna put all those banana slices.</li>
            <li>Crush the remaining wafers and put the crumbs into the pudding mix. This is easiest done if you keep the wafers in the bag and <b>break them.</b></li>
            <li>Add the banana slices into the pudding mix as well. And then mix the mix again. Oh I think I remember what that one herecy was!</li>
            <li>Pour the tasty concrete into the bowl lined with The Unbroken.</li>
            <li>???</li>
            <li>Prophets!</li>
            <li>You can just eat it now. I guess. It's also pretty good if you stick it in the fridge for a while.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Leave the Altar</h2>
        <a class="Exit" href="file:///home/kozcoko/repos/odin-recipes/index.html">You do not need anything else. There is nothing for you back there. Stay.</a>

        <h2>Condemn this blasphemer</h2>
        <p>Hah look at this stupid idiot who put his Lord on the floor to take a picture! Such disrespect. Has he no <b>reverence</b> for the Pudding?</p>
