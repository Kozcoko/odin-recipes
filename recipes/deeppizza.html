        <p>So deep dish pizza is like pizza, but you make it in a deep dish. Mind blowing stuff, really. Now you might think that We baked Ours on the stove eye, since it's in a cast iron <em>skillet.</em> Well I guess you can't really tell.. Anyways, point is, no, you cannot make DDP via stove eye heating. Well I guess you could if you really wanted to, but that's not what we're here for. Thought maybe it should be..</p>

        <p>Anyways, I don't know what most people think of in regards to deep dish pizzas, but I do know that the ones We made, and the recipe We shall share with thee soon, is really good. It has a very crunchy crust, pretty thick, but not really.. Like a mid-sized crust. But it is very cronchy. The crust does go up on the sides a good bit, so the whole crust is just like a bowl of pizza soup. Now if you're not careful with how much sauce and pineapple you put on there, you may very well think you <em>are</em> eating soup. So do warrant a tad bit'a caution on that regard.</p>
